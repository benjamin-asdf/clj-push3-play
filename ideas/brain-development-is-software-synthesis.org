* Brain Development Is A Program Synthesis

- Cognition is a kind of software, created in a software synthesis task during development
- The question of brain software is one of knowledge creation, where does the ad-hoc design of brain software come from?
- Piaget's genetic epistemology
- Cognition, biology and large scale software systems are all *evolving software*
- This is the perspective I want to take, one of platonic software animals

* Elegance Is The Missing Link Between Aesthetics, Art, Science, Creativity

** Definition and Properties
- Elegance is the property of good design (in Software design)
- The Vitruvian Triad is "durability, convenience, and beauty"
- Elegance is pragmatic, useful and *delightful*
- Elegance is mysterious, hangs together with truth, scientific discovery and art
- In pure math, an 'elegant' program is sometimes the shortest computer program with a certain input-output, given an axiomatic system A

** In Programming
- The best source code is usually not the shortest. But has to do with utilizing the material at hand, and doing so with a 'sensibleness', and 'straight forwardness'
- The best source code displays 'artistic swag', 'conscinitious' or 'technical sweetness'
- One idea would be that by modeling real-world resources, combining 'short' and 'frugal' would yield a notion of elegance closer to the one in computer programing

** Self-Evidence and Sophistication
- Beyond simplicity, the best design is self evident. Self-evidence is the true swag, beyond even beauty
- Leonardo da Vinci: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"

** In Biology
- Elegance in biology in my feel has something to do with the range of possible uses of a thing. An elegant design is one that let's one *win* in the future
- Like planning for the unplanned to occur. Because problem solving in the real world is open ended
- G. Chaitin points out that adaptationism is wrong. It get's the open endedness 'keeps on going' part of evolution wrong!
- Therefore, the problems of creativity and open endedness truly are at the cutting edge of theoretical evolutionary biology also

** Open-Endedness
- Elegance is a creative problem and therefore open ended. I.e. there is no 'most elegant' solution to anything
- The same way as we can always find out better theories of the world (Popper), we can find new creative ways of solving problems

* The Elegance Detector Hypothesis

** Core Conjecture
- Conjecture: Brain circuits implement algorithms that provide heuristics for elegance. Hypothetical *elegance detectors* would exist
- These are adapted, are encoded in the genome and can by definition not look at the content of mentality, only the hardware level implementation of it

** Mechanisms
*** Idea #1: Time
By allowing a settled activity to inhibit all alternatives, the fastest program could win

*** Idea #2: Inhibition
The amount of inhibition an activity patterns sustains could be an indication of it's connectedness to the rest of the network, making it an idea that 'fits well' with the overall memory structure (~ world model) of the network

*** Humor and Reward Connection
- Braitenberg: Maybe tickle circuits were re-used as humor circuits, activated by elegance detectors, thereby being 'fun lines' that the system can use for instance for it's reward model

* A Software System Supporting Software Animals Made From Activity

** Idea #3: Autopoetic Behavior
Behaviour (programs) that feedback activity to their own selection would be autopoetic, self-stabilizing. If activity is 'stable activity' by:
- priming the correct sensors: it implements prediction and control
- pleasing darwinian wires: it has to do with being an effective animal controller
- gaining activity support from all available network: it has to do with recruiting the complete nervous system in a resourceful manner
- inhibiting it's alternatives: it implements contrast, attention, top-down causation (self-fulfilling prophecies)
- being repeatable: it implements long term memory

* Activity Pattern Timescales

An activity pattern surviving for...

| Duration        | Manifestation                               |
|-----------------+--------------------------------------------|
| minutes / hours | situations, feelings, fleeting thoughts, day dreaming |
| hours / days    | moods, rumination                          |
| days / weeks    | habits, quirks                             |
| weeks / months  | personalities, interests, traits          |
| months / years  | the soul, the I                           |
| years - decades | rich network of memories, having a life   |


* Big goals:

- Figure out the essential components of open ended evolution
- Extract brain adaptations for software synthesis
- Consider cultural embedding for machines

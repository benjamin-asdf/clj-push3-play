Cutting edges of evolutionary computing | the algorithmic structure of natural selection as far as I currently conceptualize them.

* Metaevolution, Multidimensional Selection, Modularity and Unconvential Information Flows

Adaptationism, Abstract replicator theory (Dawkins 1976, 1982) and Gradualism (Dennett 1995) are the best theory of life, but they

- Don't explain evolutionary open endedness (creativity).
- Failed to inspire evolutionary algorithms that work.
- Don't explain why evolution works /so well/ | doesn't explain all aspects of /beauty in nature?/.
  Even Dawkins said he understands if somebody expressed this sentiment.
- Have a problem with explaining sex.
- Population Genetics models do not incoorparate symbiogenesis, horizontal gene transfer (Virusphere).
- Population Genetics models are based on changes in gene frequency, but new genes have to come from somewhere.
- I say that theoretical evolutionary biologists actually have a /richer set of algorithms in mind/ when they think of natural selection,
  and the field of evolutionary computing is now in the process of plugging the fruit of exploring /rich evolutionary algorithms/.

  Alg (1): Natural Selection v1

#+begin_src
  # the non random survival of random variations

  output: populationNextGeneration

  naturalSelection(population,threshold):
     variations := Mut(population)
     # differential survival
     survivors := filter((λ(individual) fitness(individual) >= threshold) , variations)
     return survivors

#+end_src

Where population is a set of =genomes=.

Each genome =G= is a software program, instructing a morphology (and extended phenotype) of an =organism= O.
Given an environment =env= (niche), G has a =fitness=, determining the number of it's descendants.


** Metaevolution / Meta Adaptionism

- Mutation operator: =Mut=, a function producing =varations= given a =genome= G.

  #+begin_src
  Mut(G) = G', G'', ...
  #+end_src

- Idea: Genomic =Mut= (Metaevolution): mutation operator is encoded in genes, replicates and evolves, too.
- NOT just simply random bit flips / DNA base mutations. But directed mutations.

- Evolability / Adaptability: Dynamic Mut, can depend on organismic state and epigenetics, analogoues cross-generational Baldwin effects. (so called 'Neo-Lamarckian' effects).
  But now even in the domain of Evolability.
- For example: With genetic markers, mark part of the genome essential and mutate it less, mark other part 'adaptive' and mutate more.
- Existing example: [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050106114650.htm][Jumping Genes and the Immunesytem]]

- I guess 'evolvability' is an emerging concept in biology

Experimental evolution of evolvability

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39977489/

#+begin_quote
In this work, we report the evolution of enhanced evolvability through localized hypermutation in experimental populations of bacteria. The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change. Lineages with localized hypermutability were more likely to acquire additional adaptive mutations

** Meta Adaptation

- =Mut= is adaptated. /Adaptations about adaptations/, meta adaptationism is the real deal. It is mathematically (software engineering wise) /richer/ and /more alive/ than first order adaptationism.

** Algorithmic Mutation

- We are licenced to model =Mut= via /algorithmic mutations/. The complexity of a mutation (/mutation distance/ of G to G') is equal to the 'program size complexity' of the mutation,
  aka the 'relative information content' in algorithmic complexity theory (G. Chaitin 1975 ACM paper).

- Example: 1) Doubleling the genome is a single algorithmic step. 2) Flipping all bits via the =inverse= function is simple.
  But in a bit-wise mutation paradigm (using point mutations) exponentially unlikely. (Factor 2^k where k is the number of bits).

** Modularity and Unconventional Information Flows

- combination operator: =Compose=, a mutation function producing /symbionts/, /combinations/, given 2 genomes =A=, =B=:

  #+begin_src
  Compose(A,B) = A+B
  #+end_src


- Biological mechanisms: Symbiogenesis, Sex, jumping Genes, the Virosphere.
- Natural selection is a divide and conquer algorithm, not hill climber! (R. Watson).

- A symbiogentic algorithm (using a compose function), allows joining to /separately evolved/ genomes.


- Tree Of Life =TOL= has multi-parent relantionships - Endosymbiogenis (Margulis 1967).

** Multi Dimensional Selection

Paraphrasing Dawkins, recent interview about how he writes a book:

#+begin_quote
I write a chapter and re-read it multiple time later. Everytime I imagine being a different kind of reader.
Through this Darwinian process the book is created.
#+end_quote

- Dawkins' considers a /rich set of criticisms/ to a design, i.e. a rich environment part of Darwinian process.
- Dawkins' conception of natural selection clearly incoorperates multi dimensional fitness, i.e. /apects of play/, /perspectives/.
  The way he said it, it almost comes across as the defining aspect of fitness 'good from many perspectives'.
- We need algorithms that reflect these aspects of natural selection, which are apparently obvious to the biologist.
- I think Biologists already have a richer alg in mind for natural selection. Just the translation into computer algorithms isn't done yet.

-----------------------------------------------------



- Classical Fitness: A function that returns a value given a genome =G=:

#+begin_src
  fitness(G) = r ; r ∈ R
#+end_src

- In population genetics this function is =inclusive genetic fitness= (R. Trivers, W.D. Hamilton,...).
- In coevolutionary games: "Aspects of play" (Bucci, Pollack, and De Jon 2004, De Jon and Pollack 2004).
- Say chess has 1 directive: "Play good chess". This can mean be good at the endgame, controlling the center of the board, protecting the queen and so on.
- 'Pareto coevolution' (Watson and Pollack 200a; Ficici and Pollcak 2001); Model different oponents, situations, contexts (the idea is to represent aspects of play):
- Pareto dominance function: Individual A is pareto dominant over inidividual B, if it performs equal or better in all =contexts=.

 Alg (2): Pareto Dominance

  #+begin_src

    let context-sensitive-fitness(θ,O) = fitness of individual O in context θ

    pareto-dominant?(A,B) = ∀(θ)∈contexts: context-sensitive-fitness(θ,A) >= context-sensitive-fitness(θ,B)

  #+end_src

*** Metaevolutionary Aspects of Play

- =Mut= could adapted to prefer elegant source code (elegance itself being an open ended problem).
- I say a gene could be good when it's source code looks good.
- Example: Length of the genome and other heuristics of good code.
- In terms of genes eye view: A gene can advertise to the mutation operators "Look at me, I am an elegant, fit with many other genes, I am still short, I am good source code, ...".
- Via epigenetics and unconventional genomic information flows, also: "I am useful across the tree of life (look at my epigenetic markers)".

- fitness function in biology is still /inclusive genetic fitness/, but what are the fitness contexts? It is an open ended problem creative itself, when =Mut= is complex.

------------------

- Multidimensional selection is not to be confused with 'multilevel selection'.

** Unconventional Information Flows

- Biology: the Virosphere etc.
- Jumping genes show new 'places' for mutation to occur.

- Because of =Mut= (Evolability) as adaptation, unconventional information flows can be evolved, too.
- ? Model tree of life with non-zero horizontal gene transfer between gene pools (pop genetics paradigm)?.
- ? Model =Mut= as separate evolving genome from =domain-genome= ?

** Metabiology (G. Chaitin)

- emphasize biology as software archeology
- emphasize creativity

-------------------------------

** Adaptationism

- A =replicator= is =information= (David Deutsch: knowledge) that is caused by a =niche= to be replicated.
  We say the replicator is /adapted/ to the niche.

- An /adaptation/ is a /design/ with the property that small changes in the adaptation cause it to not be adaptative anymore.
- The /alternatives/ of the design must be /possible/, natural selection requires /variations/.
- We call the /state space/ of the /search process/ of evolution /design space/.
- Similarly, for a /gene/ to be /for/ something. There must be alternative genes for variations of the /for/ in question (Dawkins).
- /Design/ is hard to fake, hard to vary, and hard to come by [Popper].
- The /hard to vary/ property can be observed indirectly via [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution][Convergent Evolution]] in nature.
  Given a niche, this is a good design - and only very slight deviations are permissible.

- *Adaptationism*: Saying that only way of obtaining /design without designer/ (sometimes "appearance of design") is via replicators and their adaptations.

- Adaption on the surface example: Camouflage: natural selection coming closer to the 'ideal' surface / visual properties of the background (niche).
- The same power of adaptation holds for all aspects of organisms: morphology, physiology, cell physiology, hormonal messanging, neural development,
  behavioural plans,... I.e. The /extended phenotype/ of a replicator.
- The 'tiny chizzles of evolution' carve at every aspect of organisms.

- *Meta Adaptionism*: The idea that 'evolability' is adaptated. A /meta adaptation/ is an algorithmic aspect of a search process.
  It lives in the mathematical space of /possible search processes/ and is thereby even more alive, more open ended, more creative
  than /domain-level adaptations/.

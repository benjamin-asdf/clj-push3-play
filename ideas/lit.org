Population-Based Evolution Optimizes a Meta-Learning Objective
https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06435

#+begin_quote
We argue that population-based evolutionary systems with non-static fitness landscapes naturally bias towards high-evolvability genomes, and therefore optimize for populations with strong learning ability. We demonstrate this claim with a simple evolutionary algorithm, Population-Based Meta Learning (PBML), that consistently discovers genomes which display higher rates of improvement over generations.

** Evolvability

Michael Barnett

Experimental evolution of evolvability
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39977489/

#+begin_quote
In this work, we report the evolution of enhanced evolvability through localized hypermutation in experimental populations of bacteria. The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change. Lineages with localized hypermutability were more likely to acquire additional adaptive mutations

- 'Metamathematics'
- Big idea 1: Mutation operators based on algorithmic complexity.

  Example: =inverse= flips every bit in the genome. Very unlikely in convenetional 'distance based' mutation operators (very unlikely to occur),
  but a primitive operation using algorithmic mutation (so very likely to occur).

  The Hamming distance is maximal but the algorithmic complexity distance is 1 step.


- Also R. Watson: 'Gradualism' might be wrong. Mutation does not need to be small changes.
  Darwinism needs to be separated from the idea of small changes.


------------------

Benjamin:

- *meta evolution*: An evolutionary algorithm where the mutation operators themselves are evolved programs.
- very similar work exists under the term 'meta-learning' in machine learning.

Dangerously close to 'punctuated equilibria'?

No, punctuated equilibria is a theory of the rate of evolutionary change;
It does not say anything about the algorithmic structure of natural selection, thereby is a relatively weak claim to begin with.

Exactly this is also Dawkin's main line of critique: Punctuated Equilibria in effect makes a strawman of gradualism, what he calls 'constant speed' gradualism.

Nobody was on the hill of 'constant speed gradualism' to begin with. The rate of change of evolution is a strictly secondary problem
to the fundamental problem of 'where cometh the design?'.

Gradualism actually as a statement of the structure of natural selection says 'there are small changes' (R. Watson).
More abstractly (what I think makes sense), there are only steps contingent in physical reality, no magic leaps (Dennett's Sky Hooks).

This is the notion of Darwinism/ Gradualism that Dawkins and Dennett would update to, being posed with the problem - I'm relatively certain of that.

For instance, it is obvious that a genome can for example =duplicate=, this is not 'a small change' in one sense, but a non-magic step nonetheless.


Within the Darwinian paradigm, one can improve on the answer. Main questions of our time are 'how is evolution open ended?' (creative)
and 'why does evolution work so well?'

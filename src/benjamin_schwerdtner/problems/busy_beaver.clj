;; Chaitin Metabiology:
;; -------------------------


;; Life == randomly evolving software
;; A single software organism O, a methematician!
;; Biological creativity == Mathematical creativity
;; Fitness of O == Busy Beaver problem == size of output
;;    (HERE: frugal busy beaver, output in relationship to execution count)
;;
;; Naming big numbers: N, N + N, N * N, N^N, N^NN N times
;; Evolution == hill-climbing random walk, O, O', O'', ...
;;
;;    (BUT: R. Watson: modularity, not hill climbing, devivide and conquer!)
;;
;; Probability of K-bit algorithmic mutation M = 2-k
;; Non-algorithmic orcacles elimitate bad mutations M
;;
;;    (HERE: no oracle, push program is executed with max execution count,
;;     handles halting problem, makes it practical)
;;
;; Fitness of O increases faster than any computable function!
;; Thus evolutions is creative, not mechanical!

;; --------------------------
;;
;;


;; - single software organism P, a program
;; - randomly mutate P until it's fitness is higher, replace P
;; - Crucial: Allow algorithmic mutaitons.
;; - M is a K-bit program that takes the original organism A as input,
;;   output:
;; - A' = M(A)
;; - probabily 2-K, probability of each transformation that can be described in K
;;   bits is 1/2K
;;
;; - `mutation distance`:
;; - log2 is the probability of going from A to B with a single mutation
;;
;; - this is the same as the 'program size complexity' of the simplest function
;;    M  with B = M(A)
;;   also known as the 'relative information content' of B given A. (G. Chaitin 1975 ACM paper)

# ARC Task Solution Summary

## Task: 91413438.json

### Pattern Recognition
The task requires:
1. Take a 3x3 input grid
2. Count the number of non-zero cells in the input
3. Create a 21x21 output grid 
4. Repeat the 3x3 pattern horizontally N times, where N = count of non-zero cells

### Implementation

#### New Grid Functions (grid_impl.clj)
1. **get-subgrid** - Extract a subgrid from given coordinates
2. **count-non-zero** - Count non-zero cells in a grid
3. **set-subgrid!** - Place a subgrid at given coordinates
4. **repeat-pattern-diagonal** - Repeat pattern diagonally (not used in final solution)
5. **repeat-pattern-horizontal** - Repeat the 3x3 pattern horizontally N times

#### New Push Instructions (instructions.clj)
1. **grid_repeat_diagonal** - Diagonal repetition instruction
2. **grid_repeat_horizontal** - Horizontal repetition instruction
3. **grid_count_non_zero** - Count non-zero cells instruction

### Final Program
```clojure
(def program
  '(grid_dup
    grid_count_non_zero      ; Count non-zero cells (e.g., 2)
    grid_swap                ; Swap to put count on integer stack
    (21 21 grid_resize_top_left)  ; Resize to 21x21
    grid_repeat_horizontal))      ; Repeat pattern horizontally N times
```

### Example Execution
Input:
```
[[0 0 8]
 [0 8 0]
 [0 0 0]]
```

Output (first 3 rows):
```
[[0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

The pattern [0 0 8; 0 8 0; 0 0 0] is repeated 2 times horizontally because there are 2 non-zero cells in the input.
